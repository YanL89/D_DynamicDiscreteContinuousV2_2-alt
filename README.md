# D_DynamicDiscreteContinuousV2_2PlusAlternatives
This is our second version of dynamic discrete-continuous choice model which allows MORE THAN TWO alternatives in the discrete choice

Library "dcmodels_1.0.01.tar.gz" must be installed before using this R package. You can find the installation instruction for R/RStudio here: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2008-August/169599.html

This example is based on simulated data. "input_data_simulation.R" is used to generate input data files which are saved under folder "simulate_data.zip". As the size of input data is larger than 25M, only partial data files have been uploaded to "simulate_data.zip" for demonstration purpose. Feel free to use "input_data_simulation.R" to generate the complete data sets. 

Model estimation file of the example is named as "estimation_simulated_data.R"

Model application files of the example is under folder "model application"

If you have any question regarding the methodology and application for using this R package, please refer to Chapter 7 of my dissertation https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/20430. In particular, Section 7.2 - 7.4 explains the methdology; Section 7.7 discusses the application background and estimation results.
